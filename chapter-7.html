    <h1>The Effect it Had on me</h1>
    <p>During this time, I moved to a new school. There, I saw various familiar faces but didn’t want to make friends until I filled up the hole that had been dug up in my heart. So, I distanced myself, I sat at the front middle desk alone, I wore a mask 24/7 even my classmates didn’t know what I looked like. They always encouraged me to hangout with them but I thought what’s the point of a friendship if it is going to end like that one. But with the effort of some amazing people who I am friends with till this day and after I decided that hiding myself isn’t a good option or way to deal with this situation, I started to get more social and became friends with some smart and amazing people.</p>
