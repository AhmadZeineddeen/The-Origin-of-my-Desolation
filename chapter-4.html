    <h1>7th grade</h1>
    <p>
        As everyone knows 7th grade is the first grade as a teen where you are the most sociable but Ali as we know lacks social skills. In this grade, most of the people in our class were people we know from kindergarten one of them is Zainab and two other girls who we’ll name Aya and Fatima. After the first semester, 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th on the class were Aya, Ali, me, Zainab and Fatima respectively, we were informed by the school that there will be a competition at the end of the year where 5 of the class had to create an invention to solve a problem. Thus, helpful me who wanted to help Ali get closer to his crush had the bright idea of creating the group with the smartest people in the class. Surprisingly, they agreed so we created a WhatsApp group which I Still think to this day is cringy and stupid, and discussed the invention idea. Well, I know I am very smart as I created this group, we all became the closest of friends we used to hang out together at recess and sit beside each other in class. This friendship continued till the 8th grade where I began to play a game called Fortnite with Ali on a daily basis, we discovered that Fatima was only using us to get free homework or free help or cheat off us in exams, and she started hanging out with a person I now consider to be my archnemesis we’ll call her Sarah. This Sarah was a pretty girl that acted as a nice person and stole Fatima from us but it is her decision so we cut ties with her and grade 8 ended early because of covid.
