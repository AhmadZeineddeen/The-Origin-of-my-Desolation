    <h1>The Origin of my Desolation</h1>
    <P>
    This will be a sad unfortunate story about the root of my sadness. This story will be posted as a website on a close friend Instagram story I hope you read it all from beggining to end. So, you guys might already know or realized that I post two types of stories. One Is about my crush which is a story for another day. However, the other type is the sad depressed one. For the sake of the people that I am going to talk about and because I am a respectful person, I am going to use fake names. Once you finish each page press on the white button to turn ti the next page.
