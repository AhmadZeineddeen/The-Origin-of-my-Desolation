    <h1>The Worst Year of my Life</h1>
    <p>
        Remember the plan about the year after 9th grade, I stuck to the plan, Ali didn’t. On the first day of 10th grade, Zainab who stayed in the same school decided to ghost Ali and break up with him and he was in a very bad mental state and although he didn’t keep a promise so crucial to our friendship, I still was there for him I supported him mentally because that’s the type of person I am. Well now with Ali and Zainab broken up, me being in another school, the friend group died and contact was cut off until 12/6/2023. And what did Ali do to replace me he became best friends with the Sarah my crush and he started detaching himself from me and when we had deep conversations, he would always say that people think they are dating because of how close they were and that cut me deep on the inside but because of our awful society that has made me grow up into an emotionless rock that cannot show feelings I kept a smile and played it off. Turns out people were right they were dating and Ali came to my house and told it to my face and I smiled it off and assured him that it was ok and that I was over her. NO, I WASN’T. I wasn’t ok with any of these things. And Ali slowly got attached and forgot all about me except for some stupid reels he’d send me on Instagram which I played off with fake laughs.
