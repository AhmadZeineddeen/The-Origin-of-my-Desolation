    <h1>The Turning Point</h1>
    <p>5th grade summer, I got back in contact with Ali and our friendship strengthened. With the start of 6th grade, I started to see Ali more and more and from that point on our friendship strengthened I remember that year I saw him at least 300 days out of the 365. I got to know him better and with that time he confessed to me that ever since 2nd grade, he had a crush on a girl who weâ€™ll call idk Zainab. We decided that year that we are going to stay together in the same school until we graduated from the same university, part of that decision is a precise plan to stay in the same school until 9th grade and then move to Tebnine Highschool until we graduate high school. We had a friendship everyone wished they would have with someone.</p>
