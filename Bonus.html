    <h1>Now</h1>
    <p>
        Something to note about the 10th grade is that it was hectic and we had a lot of class clowns. That and the fact that my parents thought that section A had the best teachers. We decided to move me to that section. At first, the class was well quiet nobody talked to nobody. I thought well damn these people are good people here to learn instead of laugh and play. Holy shit was I wrong, as time passed by, I discovered that they weren’t good people. In fact, I don’t think they were people at all, they were curdled up each into groups of 4 people talking about people behind their backs, starting rumors and even making fun of the other classmates. And there I am sitting in the middle front desk bored out of my mind and no one to talk to. Honestly, I don’t remember anything that happened inside that classroom except for the pure hatred vibe these people gave off. What I do remember though are the amazing moments I had with my friends before we got into class and on recess. It may only seem bad, but the last day of school I got extremely close with the wonderful people of section B they added me into their group chat and I got really close with them. They are the sole reason I survived this year thank you btw some of you are reading this. And what I will remember the most of this year is the fact that I was the only one helping the ungrateful classmates on the whatsapp group and when I joined the other section’s group chat, I left our section’s and I was informed that the group chat died after I left and everyone started leaving. I consider this the only win this year.
