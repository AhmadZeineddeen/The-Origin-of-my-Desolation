    <h1>The First Change </h1>
    <p>
    Ever since Ali came back, he was getting good grades but his parents weren’t satisfied for some reason, they weren’t happy with the 18/20 he was maintaining in what was considered the best school in the area. This is when they decided to move him to a school 3 hours away for the entirety of the 5th grade. During this period, we didn’t visit each other at all but we never forgot the hangouts we used to have playing Minecraft or a random-ass game off of the Xbox store, but what actually happened is that Ali struggled to make friends there and what I realized when I attended his birthday that summer is that his classmates were these rich spoiled brats that were using him for his games and money. And I made friends in my original school and didn’t think much about it.
