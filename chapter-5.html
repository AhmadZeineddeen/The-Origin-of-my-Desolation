    <h1>The Best Year of my Life</h1>
    <p>
        The 9th grade is the best year of my life, it is actually so good that I keep memories of that year inside the cover of my phone on a disk compartment of hard disk written on it in detail about that year. That year my plan that I had built for Ali and Zainab actually worked and they got into a relationship and despite covid we kept updated and talked every single day on whatsapp and played Fortnite with Ali. We used to open calls and solve the google form exams together we had the best time of our lives together. What you guys need to know about that time is that I developed a crush on Sarah thinking that she is a beautiful kind hearted person and I told Ali about it and he helped me but I never really got to tell her. And I kept in touch with Ali all that year and his relationship with Zainab worsened.
