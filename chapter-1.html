    <h1>The Beginning</h1>
    <p>It all started in kindergarten years I met a person who I’ll call Ali. We obviously weren’t close friends because well its kindergarten but I used to hang out with him and play with him from time to time. Well time passed by until the third grade, bear in mind I still was kind of friends with Ali, who at the time travelled with his family to Saudi Arabia, spent a whole year there and came back to Lebanon to the same school. The first day of 4th grade I was shocked to see him and he was still the same socially awkward person. I called him over and asked how he was been and welcomed him back. He was thrilled that someone noticed that he was back and I decided to accompany him that day. That day turned into everyday and we started getting really close and hanging out more, and because of the mutual connection between our parents I actually visited his house and he visited mine. At first, we fought but slowly we became best friends. The kind of best friends that saw each other every school day and visited each other on school days and that was the beginning of a friend ship that lasted over 6 years. </p>
